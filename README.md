# Movie Festivals Management application - Spring Boot + Angular + Primeng

This is webapplication developed as a part of an assigment using Spring Boot as a Java backend framework and Angular as a frontend framework.

It provides rich API for Festival management with support for multiple types of users, database integration and a modern looking frontend wrapper.

During development of this application I got familiar with many important parts of a modern Spring Web Application  
  
Such as:

### Spring Data
### Spring Security
### Rest APIs
### Dependency Management / Injection

And many more...
